Hi visitor! I'm Yuvraj, a 20 year old student at the University of Waterloo studying computer science. 
I love building software with impact, with technology that scales. I recently worked at Perchance as a SWE, 
contributing to the design and development of its recommendation engine.

If you're interested in the stuff I'm building, or just wanna talk tech, give me a shout!
